//#Codechef
//#Minimum Attendence Requirement

// A semester in Chef's University has 120 working days. 
// The University's requirement is that a student should be present for at least 75% of the working days in the semester. If not, the student is failed.
// Chef has been taking a lot of holidays, and is now concerned whether he can pass the attendance requirement or not. 
// N working days have already passed, and you are given N bits - B1, B2, â€¦, BN. Bi = 0 denotes that Chef was absent on the ith day, and Bi = 1 denotes that Chef was present on that day.

// Can Chef hope to pass the requirement by the end of the semester?

//e.g.:
// Input:
// 3
// 50
// 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
// 50
// 01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
// 2
// 01
// Output:
// NO
// YES
// YES
